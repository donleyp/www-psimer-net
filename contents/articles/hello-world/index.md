intro: "My first blog post."

I've started a blog! I am hoping that this can be a place where I can share ideas and news about myself and my family. 

I am using a tool called "Jekyll" to generate this website. I will write an article detailing the site architecture and the steps I took to create it. In the meantime, check out the [Jekyll Website][jekyll] for more info on Jekyll.
